# Badass Battleship Client

![preview](https://github.com/mibracy/BadassBattleship/blob/dev/client/img/preview-old.png?raw=true)

This folder contains the code for the client. Currently, the way I "run" the client is by hosting a local HTTP
server provided by NPM. So you can install NPM, or you can host this folder somewhere else to test your code. It's just
JS/HTML/CSS files, so it should not be too bad.

### With NPM
```
npm install http-server -g
```

Then, `cd` into the `client` folder and run the following:
```
http-server
```

Ta-da, the client is now live (locally).
